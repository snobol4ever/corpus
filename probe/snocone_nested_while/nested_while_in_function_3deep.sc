// nested_while_in_function_3deep.sc -- KNOWN-OPEN witness, three levels of while nesting in a function.
// SIGSEGVs as of 2026-08-27 (task snocone-triple-nested-while-baseline-drift): the fix for the 2-level
// case (snocone-nested-while-in-function-segv) does not generalize -- a freshly-planned "trailing
// statement after a nested loop" run is unconditionally baselined at local depth 0, which is only
// correct when nothing that run reaches later needs a different, non-zero baseline. Do not expect
// this file to pass without that follow-up landing first.
